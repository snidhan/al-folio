I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of California San Diego (UCSD) working with [Prof. Sutanu Sarkar](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=143). At [CFD Lab](http://cfdlab.ucsd.edu/), my research focuses on turbulent wakes behind bluff and slender bodies. I use a combination of high-fidelity numerical solutions and data-driven techniques to uncover rich dynamics of turbulent wakes. I am also interested in environmental fluid dynamics with focus on atmospheric boundary layers (ABL).
