I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of California San Diego with [Prof. Sarkar] (http://cfdlab.ucsd.edu/). Currently, my research focuses on the turbulent wakes that form behind bluff and slender bodies. I use a combination of high-fidelity numerical solutions and data-driven techniques to uncover the rich dynamics of turbulent wakes. I am also interested in environmental fluid dynamics and want to pursue it in the near future.
